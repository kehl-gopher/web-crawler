# 🕷️ Go Web Crawler

This is a  web crawler I built using **Go**, an HTML tokenizer, and **MongoDB** for data storage. It uses a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** strategy to crawl pages, extracts useful information, and stores it in a structured format.

### 🧭 Why I Chose BFS

I chose **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** over **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for crawling because it better simulates how users typically explore websites:

- **Layer-by-layer crawling:** BFS visits pages in order of discovery, ensuring I prioritize top-level pages before going deeper. This is useful when the goal is to quickly discover the most important or accessible pages.
- **Controlled growth:** By expanding outward evenly from the seed page, BFS helps avoid deep traversal into a single branch of a site, which could happen with DFS (and cause the crawler to miss broader content).


## 📌 What It Does

* Starts crawling from a seed URL.
* Uses BFS to explore and queue links.
* Parses each page using Go’s HTML tokenizer.
* Extracts information such as:

  * Page titles
  * Meta descriptions
  * All anchor tag links (`<a href>`)
* Saves the extracted data to MongoDB.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Crawling with BFS**

I implemented a BFS queue to make sure pages are visited layer by layer:

* Each new URL goes into a queue.
* Before enqueuing, I check if the URL has already been visited using a thread-safe map.
* As I dequeue and process each page, I extract and queue new links found on it.

### 2. **HTML Parsing**

Instead of using heavy HTML parsers, I used Go’s `html.NewTokenizer()`:

* It allows me to tokenize and scan the HTML stream efficiently.
* I focus on tokens like `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<a href>`.
* This low-level parsing gives me full control over what and how I extract data.

### 3. **Storing Data in MongoDB**

After parsing a page, I store the results in MongoDB in a structured format like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Example Title",
  "description": "This is an example description.",
  "added_at": "2020-01-01:T00:00:00"
}
```

This makes it easy for me to query or analyze the data later.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Set up MongoDB connection** (either via a `.env` file or directly in your config).

3. **Run the crawler:**

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
